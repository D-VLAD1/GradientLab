# GradientLab
It is my second calculus lab. Here I am using my gradient knowledge in order to train
Linear Regression, which is widely used in real life.

In the first task, I trained the intercept parameter(`b` in the `y = kx + b` formula)

In the second part, I trained the intercept and slope parameters(slope is `k` in the `y = kx + b` formula)

In the last part, I did loss visualizations also with the MSE index.
